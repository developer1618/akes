00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.900
In this grammar guide, we will be looking at lists.

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.900
When we write a list of two items, we just need the word and between them.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.400
we just need the word and between them.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
For example, I need six eggs and some flour.

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.100
Let's look at a list of three items.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.800
I need six eggs, some flour, and two tomatos.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800
As you can see, we need commas separating

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.800
all of the different items on the list.

9
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.200
We only need the word end once, and it

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.200
always goes before the last item on the list.

11
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.400
Let's look at a longer list.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.200
I need six eggs, some flour, two

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.600
tomatoes, eight apples, and a watermelon.

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.200
Again, there are commas separating all of the individual items

15
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
on the list, and we have the word and just

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.200
once before the final item on the list.
